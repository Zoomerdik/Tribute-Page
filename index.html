        <h3 id="headline">Here is a brief chronology of the life of Albert Einstein:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>March 14, 1879:</strong> Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Kingdom of WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.</li>
          <li><strong>1896-1900:</strong> He studied at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland.</li>
          <li><strong>1905:</strong> Published four groundbreaking scientific papers, including the Special Theory of Relativity,
            the theory of the photoelectric effect, and a paper on the motion of molecules in liquids. This year became known as
            Einstein's "Annus Mirabilis" or "Miracle Year."</li>
          <li><strong>1907:</strong> He married Mileva Maric.</li>
          <li><strong>1915:</strong> Published the General Theory of Relativity, which redefined the concept of gravity.</li>
          <li><strong>1919:</strong> The British expedition that tested the General Theory of Relativity's prediction of the
            deflection of starlight by the Sun confirmed the theory, making Einstein a worldwide sensation.</li>
          <li><strong>1921:</strong> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.</li>
          <li><strong>1933:</strong> Fled Germany due to the Nazi threat and moved to the United States.</li>
          <li><strong>1939:</strong> Wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning about the potential development of
            nuclear weapons and advocating for research in this area.</li>
          <li><strong>1945:</strong> The United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to the end of World
            War II.</li>

            cosmos is immeasurable."
